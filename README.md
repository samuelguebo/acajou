## Description

Acajou is a clean, simple, and fully responsive WordPress theme that feels like wood and looks awesome on any device. Its name, pronounced ***/a.kaˈʒu/*** in French, refers to a tree from tropical forests. 

It adjusts automatically to any screen size including tablets and smartphones as well as Retina displays. Theme is built using [Zurb Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites), a  framework for HTML5 / CSS3 which is SEO friendly.

Acajou is available in English, French, and Spanish for now.
