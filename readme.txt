= Do I need to regenerate my thumbnails? =
While the theme supports thumbnails out-of-the box, it's advisable to regenerate the thumbnails for the most recent articles as well as those showing up in the homepage's slider.
To do that you can install [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin.
If you didn't use featured images you can install the [Easy Add Thumbnail](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-add-thumbnail/) plugin to dinamically set featured images for old published posts.

= How do I add social icons in the menu? =
You need to add the links to your social pages in the Social menu, throug the theme customizer panel.
Icons are automatically detected based on the URL of your social page.
